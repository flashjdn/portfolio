# portfolio

portfolio repository

Planning:

- Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0ob0V0=/

- Menu bar at top of page = div
  contains logo/name, and hyperlinks to other secions of the page (random projects, about, etc)
- Image/video segment = div
  contains name FLASHJDN, a grey opacity mask to make the image/video slightly greyed out. optional quote and a button? unsure.

- Introductory segment = div

  - Picture of myself = div
  - Text boxes w/ titles, brief on who i am
  - potentially an expandable segment? (research how to do this)

- Recent projects = div

  - project cards = divs
    reusable elements? fill images from a database?
  - expandable elements? card shows synopsis, click to bring up full card?

- Socials tab = div
  - different colour to main page
  - each img will link to corresponding social media

---

## Portfolio layout

- Moon / Sun icon for theme switching to be at fixed position on top left of the screen
- Footer icons to have hover and colour change effect, but need to control margins to stop all elements in the div moving on hover size increase

## Card component

- image of app as default
- title of app underneath img
- on hover, dim display and render description text
- render two buttons:

  - Demo
  - Repo

- Transition effect to make hovered card stand out
